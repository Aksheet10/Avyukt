# Evasion 
You will get a view like this when you enter the Evasion Menu

I recommend to use In-Built Avyukt Payloads as they are Undetectable and Bypasses many Famous Anti Viruses.

Please make sure that the Framework is still under Beta Developement, More Upgrades and Updates are going to come soon

# Handlers
You will see a view like this after you enter the Handler Menu

What is Avyukt Handler?
  * Avyukt Handler is the Default Handler for the In-Built Avyukt Payloads which were Programmed by me
  * Payloads like `windows/avyukt/reverse_tcp` are compatible with Avyukt Handler
  
What is NetCat Handler?
  * NetCat is a very popular tool which you must be knowing.
  * There are some payloads in the Framework which require NetCat as a listener

What is Metasploit?
  * Come on man, You must be knowing about Metasploit, I dont have to tell it!
